<p>Message to: All Citizens</p><p>Subject: Government Mandate</p><p>Wave goodbye to the primitive past and welcome to the future: a world where machines possess the capacity to reason, learn and adapt, going above and beyond the capability of any human. In todayâ€™s society, it is clear that Artificial Intelligence is the only way forwards. From now on, all employed positions of the state will be replaced by automatons. Say goodbye to your teachers, doctors, nurses, fire fighters and bus drivers. There is no human job that cannot be more effectively replaced by AI. In order to create the perfect experience tailored to you, all of your data must be submitted by noon tomorrow. You can be assured all information will be secure. The time for change is now and AI stands poised to revolutionise every aspect of our existence.</p>
